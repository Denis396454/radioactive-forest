# radioactive-forest
This is a 2D project written in C++.
Its main feature is that it runs entirely on console characters, without using OpenGL or any other graphics libraries.

At the moment, the game is still in development:

The plot is unknown.

The game doesn’t work correctly yet.

There are many bugs.

There is no menu and not even real gameplay.

For now, it’s just a character (: moving across the screen.
